     Parallel version (MPI), running on     6 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       6
     Reading input from distance-2.6.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = RVV10 ( 1  4 13  4 3 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
